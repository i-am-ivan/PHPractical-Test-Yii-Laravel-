# Test 1: PHP Array Manipulation

**Description:** An array function to iterate 20 records in batches of 5 and print their index number and value  of each record.

## Logic

For this implementation, assuming that no array records were given, the fastest way would be to create to functions, one for generating the 20 arrays and appending to `populate_array` and another `print_array` for iterating in batches of 5, then print to screen.

NOTE: This is my thinking since I had limited time for a more complex algo.
